# Data-Structure-Dijkstra-s-and-Breadth-First-Search


This projects is a C program created for the Data Structure course. It utilizes Dijkstra's and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the shortest paths between two user-specified cities. The program reads city data, builds a graph, and calculates the shortest route, providing both the full path and total distance using each algorithm.
